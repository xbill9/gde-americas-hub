# GDE Americas Hub 🌎

The central technical hub for Google Developer Experts across the Americas.

## 🎯 About This Project

The **GDE Americas Hub** is a community-driven knowledge repository that brings together technical content, learning resources, and expertise from Google Developer Experts (GDEs) throughout North, Central, and South America, and the Caribbean.

### Why This Hub Exists

As the GDE community in the Americas continues to grow, we identified the need for a centralized platform where:

- **🌍 Regional Expertise** is accessible to all developers in the Americas
- **🤝 Collaboration** happens across countries, languages, and time zones
- **📚 Knowledge Sharing** is systematized and easily discoverable
- **🎓 Learning Paths** guide developers from beginner to expert
- **💡 Best Practices** are documented and shared by experienced practitioners

This hub serves as:

1. **A Learning Platform** - Codelabs, tutorials, and articles for developers at all levels
2. **A Resource Library** - Presentations, videos, and tools from conferences and events
3. **A Community Directory** - Connect with GDEs across the Americas
4. **A Collaboration Space** - Where GDEs contribute and maintain quality technical content

### Project Goals

- ✅ Provide high-quality, practical technical content in multiple languages
- ✅ Lower barriers to learning Google technologies across the Americas
- ✅ Foster collaboration among GDEs in the region
- ✅ Create a sustainable, community-maintained knowledge base
- ✅ Showcase the expertise and contributions of Americas GDEs

## 🚀 What's Inside

- **📚 Codelabs**: Hands-on coding tutorials across all Google technologies
- **✍️ Blog**: Technical articles and insights from GDEs
- **📊 Resources**: Presentations, videos, papers, and tools
- **🎓 Learning Paths**: Structured journeys to master Google technologies
- **👥 Community**: GDE directory, events, and forums

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gde-americas/gde-americas-hub.git
cd gde-americas-hub

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start development server
mkdocs serve
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser.

### Build

```bash
# Build static site
mkdocs build

# Output will be in site/ directory
```

## 🚀 Deployment

This site is automatically deployed using **Netlify** with continuous deployment from GitHub.

### How It Works

**Every time code is pushed:**

1. **Main Branch** → Automatic production deployment
   - Generates all codelabs from source markdown
   - Builds the MkDocs site
   - Deploys to production URL

2. **Pull Requests** → Automatic deploy previews
   - Each PR gets a unique preview URL
   - Perfect for reviewing codelabs before merging
   - No local setup needed for reviewers!

3. **Other Branches** → Branch deployments
   - Test features before creating a PR

### What Gets Deployed

The build process automatically:
- Installs `claat` tool
- Exports all codelabs from `docs/codelabs/source/*.md`
- Builds the MkDocs site with all content
- Deploys to Netlify's global CDN

### Local vs Production

**Local Development:**
```bash
# 1. Write your codelab source
vim docs/codelabs/source/my-codelab.md

# 2. Export locally to preview (OPTIONAL)
./scripts/export-codelab.sh docs/codelabs/source/my-codelab.md android

# 3. Preview with MkDocs
mkdocs serve

# 4. Commit ONLY the source file
git add docs/codelabs/source/my-codelab.md
git commit -m "Add codelab: My Tutorial"
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Generated HTML files are **automatically git-ignored**. Do NOT commit them!

**Production Build (Automatic):**
```bash
# When you push to GitHub, Netlify automatically:
1. Installs claat tool
2. Exports codelabs from source/*.md (incremental for PRs, full for production)
3. Builds MkDocs site
4. Deploys to production/preview URL
```

**Why This Approach?**
- ✅ Clean repository (no generated files)
- ✅ No merge conflicts on HTML
- ✅ Faster PR reviews
- ✅ Always consistent (generated from source)
- ✅ Smaller repo size

See [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml) for the full build configuration.
