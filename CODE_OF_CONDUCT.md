Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Resolve Peacefully

We believe that healthy debate and disagreement are important parts of a vibrant community. Disagreements, both technical and otherwise, are normal and expected.

However, **disrespect is never acceptable.**

If you see problematic behavior:

1. **Address Directly** (if safe and comfortable): Politely point out the behavior
2. **Use De-escalation**: Try to lower the temperature of the conversation
3. **Step Away**: It's okay to disengage from heated discussions
4. **Report**: If behavior continues or is serious, report it
